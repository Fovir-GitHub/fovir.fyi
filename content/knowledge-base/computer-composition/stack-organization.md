## Definition

A register is used to store the address of the topmost element of the stack is known as **stack pointer (SP)**.

ALU operations are performed on stack data, where both operands are always required on the stack, and after manipulation, the result is placed in the stack.

The main two operations that are performed on the operators of the stack are **push** and **pop**.
